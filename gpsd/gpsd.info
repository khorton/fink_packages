Description: GTK+ based lightweight and fast e-mail client
DescDetail: <<
  Sylpheed is an e-mail client (and news reader) based on GTK+, running on
  X Window System, and aiming for
   * Quick response
   * Graceful, and sophisticated interface
   * Easy configuration, intuitive operation
   * Abundant features
  The appearance and interface are similar to some popular e-mail clients for
  Windows, such as Outlook Express, Becky!, and Datula. The interface is also
  designed to emulate the mailers on Emacsen, and almost all commands are
  accessible with the keyboard.
  
  The messages are managed by MH format, and you'll be able to use it together
  with another mailer based on MH format (like Mew). You can also utilize
  fetchmail or/and procmail, and external programs on receiving (like inc or
  imget).
  
  Note: Now includes ssl capabilty.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  Early gtk1 versions packaged by Masanori Sekino.
  
  dmacks overhauled for v2/gnome2
  dmacks--omit the second pass .o.c recompile for the convenience lib
  
  Kevin Horton took over sylpheed for v2.3.0 and created sylpheed-gpgme
  package to replace sylpheed-ssl.  The ssl functionality was added to
  the basic sylpheed package.  sylpheed-ssl is a dummy package to ease
  upgrading to sylpheed-gpgme from sylpheed-ssl.
